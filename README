This is an AmigaOS shared library implementation of the zlib library from
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler (https://www.zlib.net/).

There have been a couple of other zlib shared library conversions using the
same name in the past, but the API of this one should be backwards compatible
with them both so replacing either of them with this one shouldn't cause any
problems.
