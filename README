This is an AmigaOS shared library implementation of the zlib library from
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler (https://www.zlib.net/).

There have been a couple of other zlib shared library conversions (by other
developers) using the same name in the past but the API of this one should be
backwards compatible with them both, so replacing either of them with this one
shouldn't cause any problems.
